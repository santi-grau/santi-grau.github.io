				| Research of the use of science to achieve new results in the visual arts within the framework of quantum physics.

				| Collaborating with a physicist, this project explores the connections between science and design creating a 'typewriter' that will a set of particles with different entropies in real-time every time a new letter is typed.

				| According to the laws of quantum physics, objects donâ€™t have fixed positions. Instead, we can only define the probabilities of finding them in a given places. As a consequence, standard concepts in typography like the distance between letters (kerning), line spacing, letter eye or x-height become meaningless. New typographic parameters are originated, such as the number of points composing the letters, the spread of the points or the size of each point.
